# Last Men Standing
This repository contains a simulation/game called *Last Men Standing* (henceforth: *LMS*) and which is released into the public domain.

## The vision
In the year 1994, I envisioned a game which might perhaps was called a rogue like game nowadays.

However, the vision makes certain demands on the quality of video and audio, haptics, and mechanics of the game, which could not be realized with the means at the time. For example, the computing power of computing devices (which were available to the wider public) was insufficient. For example, the audio and video devices with output of a certain quality were not available to the wider public. ... Back then a seemingly overhelming set of barriers made me stop efforts to realize my vision. The vision became a childhood memory, a vivid techno-dream that is part of the nostalgia you succcumb to from a certain age on.

In the year 2021, I realized that many of these barriers are gone. Audio and video devices with output of sufficient quality are available to the wider public. The computing power of computing devices (which are available to the wider public) is sufficient. I also realized, the limiting factor will be me and my ability to create a community of artists / programmers to realize my vision. Challenge accepted.

## Code of Operations
This information technology project consists of an ever repeating cycle of tasks executed with a specific weighting and order depending on the needs of the project:

- Evolve the assets/the code of *LMS*.
- Grow the community of artists / programmers.
- Communicate *my* vision of *LMS* to the artists / programmers and players alike.
- Grow the community of players.

The individual project member can determine - for himself - to which task he/she devotes his/her time to. Remember: Every task is important.

## Code of Conduct
Every organization requires a code of conduct. That code of conduct might evolve. Before joining this project, please be perfectly aware of a few thing:

- This is a *personal pet project* of mine: You can join my vision, you can share my vision, you convince me to change my vision. But you may not go against my vision in this project.
- I intend this not to be a technology-/self-centered project producing a game for a small or specific target audience. This is for the masses, for the players.

# The results

> :warning: **Warning**: *Last Men Standing* is under development and is not yet ready for use! This is a *personal pet project* and I only get a couple of hours a week so progress can be slow. But hopefully there soon is enough material to show the intended direction of the project. 

> :warning: **Warning**: You cannot actually do much with *LMS* in its current state! 

The instructions below allow you to run the technology demo - trivial technology for that matter - the game is currently is. Currently this project is merely a demonstration of some technical trivialities:
 - WGL and OpenGL 2.0,
 - GLFW and GLAD, and
 - FreeType 2.

# Primordial Machine
This repository contains the sources and assets of a game and its engine called *Primordial Machine*.
Furthermore, it contains the sources of the documentation of the software and the underlying principles and methods used to built the game and the software.
The sources, the assets, and the documentation are made available publicly by
the eponymous organization *Primordial Machine* under a free software license.

### The purpose
Primordial Machine - the engine and the game and the documentation - are made available publicly for recreational and educational purposes.

### Code of Operations
This information technology project consists of an ever repeating cycle of tasks executed with a specific weighting and order depending on the needs of the project:

- Evolve the assets/the sources/the documentation of *Primordial Machine*.
- Grow the community of artists / programmers / writers.
- Communicate *my* vision of *Primordial Machine* to the artists / programmers / writers and players alike.

The individual project member can determine - for himself - to which task he/she devotes his/her time to.
Remember: Every task is important.

## Code of Conduct
Every organization requires a code of conduct. That code of conduct might evolve. Before joining this project, please be perfectly aware of a few thing:

- This is a *personal pet project* of mine: You can join my vision, you can share my vision, you convince me to change my vision.
  But you may not go against my vision in this project.
- I intend this not to be a technology-/self-centered project producing a game for a small or specific target audience.
  This is for the masses, for the players.

# The results

> :warning: **Warning**: *Primordial Machine* is under development and is not yet ready for use!
This is a *personal pet project* and I only get a couple of hours a week so progress can be slow.
But hopefully there soon is enough material to show the intended direction of the project.

## How to build
Currently, *Primordial Machnine* is known to build under Visual Studio 2022 Community/Windows 11 targeting Windows 11.
By design, the effort to port *Primordial Machine* to other build environments and other execution environments should be moderate.
Please refer to section *How to contribute* if you want to contribute a port to the project.

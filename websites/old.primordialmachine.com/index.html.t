  Where does the name Primordial Machine come from?
  </faq-q>
  <faq-a>
  The name of this website Primordial Machine is a reference to a recurring wording from an extracurricular work of mine.
  I used the term Machine as an abbreviation for model of a computing machine.
  That work also developed different machines based on each other.
  The machine which was the common origin of all these machines consequently was called the Primordial Machine.

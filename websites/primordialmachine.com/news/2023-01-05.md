Primordial Machine's Scribe is used to generate parts of the engine.
Scribe CAS and TE are used to generate most of the code for the mathematical libraries used by the engine.

## Scribe CAS and TE
Scribe CAS is a computational algebra system generating the code for mathematical expresssion.
It is used to generate the C code for operations over matrices and vectors in the math library of the engine.

Scribe TE is a template engine.
It is used to generate the C code for operations over matrices and vectors for various types and dimensionalities.

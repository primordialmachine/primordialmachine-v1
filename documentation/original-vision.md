### The original vision
In the year 1994, I envisioned a game which might perhaps was called a rogue-like/rogue-lite game nowadays.
However, the vision makes certain demands on the quality of video and audio, haptics, and mechanics of the game,
which could not be realized with the means at the time.
For example, the computing power of computing devices (which were available to the wider public) was insufficient.
For example, the audio and video devices with output of a certain quality were not available to the wider public.
Back then a seemingly overwhelming set of barriers made me stop efforts to realize my vision.
The vision became a childhood memory, a vivid techno-dream that is part of the nostalgia you succumb to from a certain age on.
In the year 2021, I realized that many of these barriers are gone.
Audio and video devices with output of sufficient quality are available to the wider public.
The computing power of computing devices (which are available to the wider public) is sufficient.
I also realized, the limiting factor will be me and my ability to create a community of artists / programmers to realize my vision.
I accept that challenge.

/// A fragment is passed on in the pipeline if its depth test succeeds, otherwise it is discarded.
/// A fragment is passed /is discarded depends on three factors:
/// - the depth value of the fragment
/// - the depth value in the depth buffer
/// - the depth test function used to compare the depth values.
/// This enumeration enumerates symbolic constants denoting the possible depth test functions.
